# Book Store Data Generator

A web app for generating realistic, locale-specific fake book data for bookstore application testing.  
Built with **Next.js** (React) and **Faker** for server-side random data generation, supporting infinite scrolling, CSV export, and dynamic views.

> **Note:** The app is hosted on Render‚Äôs free tier, so it might take up to 60 seconds to open due to cold launches.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Locale & Language Selection:** Choose from multiple languages/regions (English/USA, Turkish/Turkey, Russian/Russia, Chinese/China).
- **Seed Control:** Enter your own seed or generate a random one. Using the same seed always produces the same data (deterministic).
- **Likes & Reviews Control:**  
  - Specify average **likes per book** (slider, 0‚Äì10, fractional supported, e.g. 3.7).
  - Specify average **reviews per book** (number field, fractional supported, e.g. 4.7).
- **Dynamic Regeneration:**  
  - Changing any parameter (locale, seed, likes, reviews) instantly regenerates and updates the book list.
- **Infinite Scrolling:**  
  - Loads the first 20 records, then dynamically loads 10 more as you scroll down.
- **Deterministic Results:**  
  - The same settings (seed, locale, likes/reviews) always produce the same data, even across sessions.
- **Realistic Data:**  
  - Titles, authors, publishers, ISBNs, and reviews are generated using [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) with language-specific data for authenticity.
- **Table View:**  
  - Shows:
    - Index
    - ISBN
    - Book Title
    - Author(s)
    - Publisher
  - Each row is **expandable** to show book cover (with title/author rendered), reviews and review authors.
- **Gallery View:**  
  - Switch to a tile-based layout for visual browsing.
- **CSV Export:**  
  - Exports all currently loaded books to CSV with proper escaping (using a ready-made library).

## üö¶ How It Works

1. **User selects language/region, enters or randomizes seed, sets likes/reviews averages.**
2. **Frontend** sends these parameters to the server `/api/books` endpoint.
3. **Server** (API route) uses [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) with seeded random to generate "realistic" books on the fly, in the appropriate language.
4. **Books are never stored in a database.** All data is generated on-demand, deterministically, on the server.
5. **Infinite scroll**: When user scrolls down, new batches are requested with updated offset/batch, using a combination of seed and batch number to ensure deterministic results.
6. **Likes and reviews**: Fractional values are supported, so e.g. 4.7 reviews means each book gets 4 or 5 reviews, with the 5th added with 70% probability. Changing likes/reviews does not affect book identity, only the count/contents.
7. **Expanding a book row** shows a generated cover, reviews, etc.
8. **Switching locale or seed** instantly regenerates the books accordingly.
